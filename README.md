# Modpacks for My Minecraft Servers

This repository contains the modpacks used on the various Minecraft servers that I run. 

Each pack is built for a different group I play with, but most are heavily modded and performance‑tuned.

All packs are available for anyone to download, tweak, and use on their own servers or single-player worlds.

## Server Status

You can see the uptime of my servers/services [HERE](https://status.liamelias.com/status/services)

## Latest Modpack

For the most recent modpack file for any server, please take a look at the releases on the right side of the page.

For any accompanying server side modpack please look in the appropriate folder for the .mrpack file with the -server suffix.

## Keybindings

If you would like use the keybinds that I use, the options.txt file is in the modpack folder as well as in each pack release.

Keep in mind that I use a standard, 100% size keyboard and you may need to bind new keys to suit your specific keyboard.

After running the instance once, replace the existing options.txt file in the root folder of your instance with the one provided. 

## Usage

Feel free to:
- Download and play the packs as‑is  
- Modify them for your own servers
