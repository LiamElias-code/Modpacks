# Modpacks for My Minecraft Servers

This repository contains the modpacks used on the various Minecraft servers that I run. 

Each pack is built for a different group I play with, but most are heavily modded and performance‑tuned.

All packs are available for anyone to download, tweak, and use on their own servers or singleplayer worlds.
